# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers from the starting number to the ending number, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

  result = (starting_number..ending_number).map do |number|

      "FizzBuzz"
    elsif number % 3 == 0
      "Fizz"
    elsif number % 5 == 0
      "Buzz"
    else
      number
    end
  end.join(", ")
  
  puts result
